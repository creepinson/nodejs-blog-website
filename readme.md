# Node.js Blog Website
### Made with Express, Mongoose, and Bootstrap. 


## Let's Get Started
To get started, simply download and install mongodb onto your host computer and create a database called *blog*. If you call it anything else, make sure you change the URL mongoose connects to in *server.js*.

Next you can git clone the repository here and run *PASSWORD=YOUR_BLOG_PASSWORD_HERE npm run start*.
To visit the blog, navigate to *http://your_site_url_or_ipL8080/blog*.
To add a post, simply navigate to *http://your_site_url_or_ip:8080/blog-admin* in your favorite internet browser and type in the required details above the button labeled Add Post. You can add HTML tags in your blog post content as well. Once you are done and have memorized the blog post title click Add Post. 
When removing a post, simply enter the **exact** post title seen in /blog and click Delete Post. It does not warn you before deleting a post, so be careful!

## Features To Be Added:
    - Simplified Style Settings in the Blog Admin area
